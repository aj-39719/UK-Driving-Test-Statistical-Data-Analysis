# UK-Driving-Test-Statistical-Data-Analysis

We used Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis over categorical variables like Age, Gender and Location of Testing center to conclude the following:

XYZ’s expected passing rate at the nearest test centre to his home is 54.4833349 %
XYZ’s expected passing rate at the nearest test centre to the LSE is 45.8092649 %
Our friend has a better chance of passing the driving test if he gives it in the testing center near his home, i.e., Tolworth.
As seen from past data, he has better odds of passing since he is Male.
However, his chances decrease by roughly 4% every year he choses not to give the test, so he should give it as soon as possible.
